# Coins Detection
This project is a Computer Vision Short Program aims to detect circular coins Using **OpenCV-Python Module** and *Hough Circle Algorithm*.

### Overview
It's a capstone project as part of [Python Programmer Bootcamp - Data Science 365](https://learn.365datascience.com/courses/python-programmer-bootcamp). Its objectif was to apply and solidify python programming concepts such as:
- Function
- Different Data Types
- Loops
- Flow Control
- Circle Detection

With less than **100 lines of code**, the program can:
- Detect coins in an image.
- Classify them based on their radii and brightness.
- Label each coin with its respective value.
- Calculate the total value of all coins.

## Example Output.

#### Input
<img src="Images/1-Original.png" alt="Original Image" width="500" height="500">

#### Output
<img src="Images/4-Final-output-with-coins-sum.png" alt="Final Image" width="500" height="500">

## Features
1. Coins Detection.
2. Coins Classification (by radii and brightness).
3. Coins Labeling with determined value.
4. Sum Calculation on the image.
